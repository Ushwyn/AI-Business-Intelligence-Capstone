# AI-Business-Intelligence-Capstone

## 🚀 Project Title:
**Enabling AI-Powered Business Intelligence for Organizations**  
_Simplilearn AGS Capstone Project_

## 📌 Project Description
This project aims to build a smart business intelligence tool that leverages AI to answer questions from sales data. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, FAISS for vector search, and Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface. The goal is to help organizations make informed decisions quickly using natural language queries on structured and unstructured datasets.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- LangChain
- HuggingFace Transformers
- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- Streamlit
- Pandas & Numpy

## 📂 Features
- Intelligent Q&A system on sales data
- Embedding generation from documents
- Efficient similarity search using FAISS
- Streamlit-powered frontend for user interaction
- End-to-end AI-powered business insight platform

## 🧠 How it Works
1. Preprocess and chunk the dataset
2. Generate embeddings using Sentence Transformers
3. Store and index data using FAISS
4. Create a RetrievalQA chain using LangChain
5. Deploy a Streamlit app for real-time Q&A

## 🖼️ Screenshots
Screenshots of the app and interface are included in the `screenshots/` folder.
